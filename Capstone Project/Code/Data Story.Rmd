### 1. Problem: Housing affordability in San Jose

  Affordable housing is a major concern in the Bay Area of California. Many people are priced out of affordable housing options where the median home price has reached close to $1 million in San Jose. This trend impacts low and median income families looking to secure home ownership. Politicians and voters have voiced their concerns and willingness to address this issue by approving new policies at the ballot box. Last November voters passed Measure A allowing the city to issue \$950 million in new bonds for affordable housing.^1^ The current mayor of San Jose, Sam Liccardo, has said San Jose is facing an affordable housing crises.^2^ To help address this issue I'd like to take a look at recent median home price trends and also predict how prices will change in the near term. This information will help to keep track of affordability and give insights into the effectivness of government policy changes. 

### 2. Data

  The main source of data will be from the City of San Jose <http://data.sanjoseca.gov/home>. Economic and labor data including unemployment, total jobs, jobs by sector, median home prices, median rental prices will all be utilized along with broader economic data such as average mortgage rates from FRED <https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/?g=NUh#0>. The most important fields of the data set will be median home prices for a single family home, labor data, and 30-year mortgage rates. All these fields should give the most insight into historical median home prices and some of the economic conditions driving prices. Of course there are many socioeconomic factors both mico and macro that drive home prices for any one area, I limited the data to the most revelant provided by the city of San Jose. With more time and resources it would be ideal to analyze dozens of variables to give the most insight. Due to the limited amount of variables it may be difficult to pinpoint specific drivers of median home prices or predict future prices accurately. 
  
  
### 3. Wrangling


### 4. Preliminary Exploration and Findings


### 5. Approach
  
  From exploration of the data there are a couple of approaches I'd like to take to gain insight into which variables are driving median home values and prediction of median home values going forward. For the former I'll use regression analysis to determine which variables are best at predicting median home prices. My expectation is the labor data may be a leading indicator while mortage prices will be a lagging indicator. For prediction of median home prices going forward I'll use a prediction model based on the historical median home price values over the last 10 years. The model should be able to predict median home values with a high level of confidence in the short term.
